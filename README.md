This is a parser for a downloaded version of the Gnostic Book of Changes 
(James deKornne if I remember right).
It's designed to be a personal iching serving script.

TODO:

- try https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html for getting these read
    into a YAML
- yaml into a giant html file
- make the right yarrow stick simulation
- make a d3 dom thingy to build the page
